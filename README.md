Trying to learn Node by making a simple social network for hating things using node.js, express, passportjs, mongoose and mongodb.

What's done so far:
	Creating hate.
	Listing hate.
	Upvoting hate.
  	Commenting hate.
  	Sessions and authentication.

Todo:
	Signup.
	Proper MVC structure, right now it's all kinda thrown together.
	Hategroups.
	Different options for listing hate. (creation date, hate rate, comment count, by haters and creators?!)
	Adding and uploading images.
	Pretty graphics.
