Trying to make a simple hate list using node.js, express and mongodb. 
Might add passport.js authentication later.

What's done so far:
	Creating hate.
	Listing hate.
	Upvoting hate.

Todo:
	Commenting hate.
	Different options for listing hate. (creation date, hate rate, comment count, by haters and creators?!)
	Adding and uploading images.
	Sessions and authentication.
	Pretty graphics.
